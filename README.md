## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to one of our projects, you are more than welcome to do so. We recommend creating an issue on the project's repository so your proposed changes can be discussed and any questions you have can be answered. Then, when a plan of approach has been decided on, you are welcome to create a pull request for that project and we will review your changes as a community.

Anyone can review changes in a pull request - you do not need to have write access to provide feedback.

Each project will have a copy of our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) with specific information added for that project. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a streamlined workflow.
